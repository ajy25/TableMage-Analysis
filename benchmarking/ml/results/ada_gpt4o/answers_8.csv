Dataset ID,Unformatted Answer
361111,The test AUROC of the best model is 0.718. 
361286,The best test AUROC achieved is 0.722. 
361070,The training process took too long to complete. I’ll optimize the model selection and hyperparameters to ensure the best possible performance within a reasonable time. Let me retry and provide the AUROC score. The test AUROC of the best possible model trained is 0.594. 
361278,DNF
361093,0.086 
361094,The test RMSE of the best trained model is 0.056. 
361288,The test RMSE of the best model is 2.167. 
361072,DNF
361076,The test RMSE of the best model is 0.603. 
361279,The best test RMSE achieved is 0.028. 
361280,The test RMSE of the best model is 2.156.
