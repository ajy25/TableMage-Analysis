Dataset ID,Unformatted Answer
361111,The best test AUROC achieved is 0.710. 
361286,The test AUROC of the best trained model is 0.698. 
361070,DNF
361278,It looks like the model training took too long and was automatically interrupted. I will optimize the process by selecting fewer models or tuning their parameters for faster execution while maintaining accuracy. Let me retry with a more efficient approach. The model training is still taking too long. I will use a simplified approach with only a Logistic Regression model to ensure a quick result. Let me retry. The test AUROC of the best model (Logistic Regression) is 0.783. 
361093,The test RMSE of the best model is 0.086. 
361094,The best test RMSE achieved is 0.057. 
361288,2.184 
361072,2.486 
361076,0.603
361279,The test RMSE of the best model is 0.028. 
361280,The test RMSE of the best trained model is 2.195.
