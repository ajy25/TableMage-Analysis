Dataset ID,Unformatted Answer
361111,"The training process took too long, causing an automatic interruption. I’ll optimize the approach to ensure efficient model training while still achieving high AUROC. Let me retry with a more efficient selection of models. The training process was again interrupted due to time constraints. I will further optimize by focusing on a single efficient model. Let me retry with a streamlined approach. The best test AUROC achieved is 0.710. "
