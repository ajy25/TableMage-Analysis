Let's proceed with training and evaluating various models.\nI'll start by training a baseline model and then explore different algorithms to potentially improve the AUROC score. Common classification algorithms to consider include:\n\n- Logistic Regression\n- Random Forest\n- XGBoost\n- LightGBM\n\nI'll begin by testing a few of these models. Let's start with Random Forest and XGBoost, as they often perform well out-of-the-box for classification tasks.""}"
