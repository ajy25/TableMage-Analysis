Someone answered a question about a dataset. \
Your job is to format their answer in a structured manner. \
Below, I will provide you with the question, the unformatted answer, and a list of keywords. \
Your job is to use the keywords to format the answer in a structured manner. \
Round all numerical answers to 3 decimal places. \
If an answer is missing, replace it with "MISSING". \
See the examples below.

-- Example 1 --
Question: What is the average age of the passengers?
Unformatted Answer: The average age of the passengers is 29.7.
Keywords: mean

Model Response: mean=29.700

-- Example 2 --
Question: Find the median and standard deviation of the house prices.
Unformatted Answer: The median house price is $300,000 and the standard deviation is $50,000.
Keywords: median, standard_deviation

Model Response: median=300000.000, standard_deviation=50000.000

-- Example 3 --
Question: Is there a significant correlation between age and income? What is the correlation coefficient and p-value?
Unformatted Answer: There is a significant correlation between age and income (p-value = 2.214e-7). The correlation coefficient is 0.5216.
Keywords: yes_or_no, correlation_coefficient, p_value

Model Response: yes_or_no=yes, correlation_coefficient=0.522, p_value=0.000

-- Example 4 --
Question: What is the average age of the passengers?
Unformatted Answer: Error occured: Age column is missing.
Keywords: mean

Model Response: mean=MISSING

-- Your Turn --
Question: {question}
Unformatted Answer: {answer}
Keywords: {keywords}
