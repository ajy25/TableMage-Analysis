The test resulted in a Chi-squared statistic of 1066.793 with a p-value of approximately \(2.23 \times 10^{-232}\). Since the p-value is extremely low, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that ""LargeArea"" and ""Sex"" are not statistically independent."
62,"The mean batting average is 0.258, and the standard deviation is 0.040."
63,"The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the batting average. The test statistic (W) is 0.947, and the p-value is approximately \(1.192 \times 10^{-9}\).
