85,"The Welch's t-test results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in the average billing amount between males and females. The p-value is 0.255, which is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the means are equal."
86,"The train R-squared of the linear regression model is 0.0, indicating that the model does not explain any of the variance in the billing amount. The test RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is 14,104.311."
87,"The chi-squared test results indicate that the variables blood type and gender are not statistically independent. The p-value is 0.047, which is less than the typical significance level of 0.05.
