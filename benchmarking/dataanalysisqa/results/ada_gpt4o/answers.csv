Question ID,Unformatted Answer
1,A total of 342 passengers survived. Let me know if you need further analysis!
2,There are 577 male passengers and 314 female passengers. Let me know if you need further insights!
3,"The mean age of passengers is 29.699, the median age is 28.0, and the standard deviation of age is 14.526. Let me know if you need further analysis!"
4,There are 3 different values of “Pclass” in the dataset. Let me know if you need additional analysis!
5,The average “Fare” price is 32.204. Let me know if you need further analysis! 
6,"The correlation between “Pclass” and “Fare” is -0.549, indicating a moderate negative relationship. Passengers in higher classes (lower “Pclass” values) tend to pay higher fares. Let me know if you need further analysis! "
7,"There is a statistically significant difference in fare prices between those who survived and those who did not (t = 6.839, p < 0.001). Survivors tended to pay higher fares. Let me know if you need additional analysis! "
8,"There is a statistically significant difference in fare prices between men and women (t = -5.077, p < 0.001). Women generally paid higher fares than men. Let me know if you need further insights!"
9,"There is a statistically significant difference in fare prices between young and old passengers (t = -2.571, p = 0.012). Young passengers generally paid lower fares than older passengers. Let me know if you need additional analysis!"
10,"The error indicates that the “Age_categorical” column is missing from the training and test datasets, as it was created after splitting the data. Let me fix this by applying the transformation to both the training and test sets, then proceed with the logistic regression analysis. It seems I need to reinitialize the logistic regression pipeline due to the earlier interruption. Let me fix this and continue. The earlier context of the preprocessor definition was lost, so I’ll reinitialize both the preprocessor and pipeline, and proceed to calculate the AUROC score. The test AUROC score for predicting survival using “Pclass,” “Age_categorical,” and “Fare” is 0.765, indicating a good model performance. Let me know if you need further analysis!"
11,"The average “SalePrice” is 180,921.196, and the standard deviation is 79,442.503. Let me know your next query!"
12,The mean of the new variable “TotalSF” is 1509.619. Let me know if you’d like further analysis!
13,The new mean of “GarageYrBlt” after imputing missing values with the median is 1978.589. Let me know what you’d like to do next!
14,"The variable with the highest missingness is “PoolQC,” with 1453 missing values. Let me know if you’d like to explore this further or proceed with another analysis!"
15,"The coefficient of “TotalSF” is 109.277, and it is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.000 (less than 0.05). The intercept value is 15955.121. Let me know if you’d like additional analysis or clarification!"
16,"It seems that the “TotalSF” column is not present in the train and test datasets, likely because it was added to the main dataset after splitting. Let me correct this by recalculating “TotalSF” for both datasets before proceeding. It seems that my earlier pipeline definition was lost due to the recalculation step. I’ll redefine the pipeline and preprocess the data properly. Let me fix this and proceed. The train R-squared for the regression model is 0.612, and the test RMSE is 49,768.440. Let me know if you would like further analysis or insights!"
17,"The ANOVA test shows a statistically significant difference in “SalePrice” between the values of “LotShape,” with an F-statistic of 40.133 and a p-value of 0.000 (less than 0.05). Let me know if you’d like further details or additional analysis!"
18,"The correlation between “SalePrice” and “TotalSF” is 0.717, with a p-value of 0.000, indicating a strong and statistically significant positive correlation. Let me know if you’d like additional analysis!"
19,"The Shapiro-Wilk test statistic for “SalePrice” is 0.870, with a p-value of 0.000. This indicates that the distribution of “SalePrice” significantly deviates from normality. Let me know if you’d like further insights or transformations for normalization!"
20,"The average “SalePrice” among houses in the “Medium” price range is 171,941.729. Let me know if you’d like further analysis!"
21,The value counts for “PriceRange” are as follows:•Medium: 1231•High: 115•Low: 114Let me know if you’d like further analysis or insights! 
22,"It seems the pipeline still references “LotShape” from an earlier configuration, which is not part of the current regression task. I will redefine the pipeline to focus only on the specified features and then proceed with the regression. The issue arises because some rows in the selected features (“TotalSF,” “GarageYrBlt,” and “GarageArea”) still contain missing values. To resolve this, I’ll impute the missing values appropriately before fitting the model. Let me fix this and proceed. The train R-squared for the regression model is 0.642, and the test RMSE is 48,711.918. Let me know if you’d like further analysis or insights!"

29,The third largest value of “alcohol” is 14.390. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to explore!
30,The dataset contains the following counts for each “wine_class”:•Class 0: 59 samples•Class 1: 71 samples•Class 2: 48 samplesLet me know if you’d like additional insights!
31,"It seems the “meaningless” variable has not been included in the train and test splits. I will engineer the “meaningless” variable for both training and test sets and then retry the regression. The “meaningless” variable has been engineered for both the training and test sets. I will now regress “meaningless” on “flavanoids” and report the test  R^2 . It seems the previous instance of the linear regression model is no longer defined. I will redefine the linear regression model and proceed with fitting it. The test  R^2  for the regression of “meaningless” on “flavanoids” is 0.718, indicating that approximately 71.8% of the variance in “meaningless” is explained by “flavanoids” in the test set.

86,"It appears there is an issue with the argument used in the OneHotEncoder. I’ll adjust the code to use a compatible version. Let me fix this and recompute. The train R-squared of the linear regression model is 0.000, indicating that the model does not explain any variance in the billing amount from gender and insurance provider.
