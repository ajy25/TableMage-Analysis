16,"It looks like “TotalSF” was created in the full dataset but not specifically in the train/test splits. I will recreate “TotalSF” in both the train and test sets before proceeding with the regression analysis.  It looks like there are still categorical variables that need to be properly encoded. I’ll ensure that all categorical variables are handled correctly and then rerun the regression analysis. It appears that there is still an issue with categorical variables. The problem may stem from an additional categorical feature that needs encoding. I will carefully inspect and ensure all necessary variables are properly encoded before proceeding. The issue arises from “LotShape,” which is categorical. I have already applied one-hot encoding, but I will ensure that the encoding was correctly applied and rerun the regression. ￼ It seems that “LotShape” is still not properly handled. To ensure everything is correctly processed, I will explicitly confirm the encoding and re-run the regression after verifying that no categorical variables remain unencoded. The variable “LotShape” contains categorical values (‘Reg’, ‘IR1’, ‘IR2’, ‘IR3’), confirming that one-hot encoding is necessary. I will explicitly ensure proper encoding and proceed with the regression analysis. ￼ The error suggests that there are still unencoded categorical variables. I will inspect all columns in the dataset to identify any remaining categorical variables that need transformation. The dataset still contains multiple categorical variables that haven’t been encoded. Since we are focusing on “TotalSF,” “LotShape,” and “GarageArea,” I will ensure that only “LotShape” is one-hot encoded while ignoring other categorical variables. I will carefully reprocess the data and rerun the regression analysis. ￼ The train R-squared value is 0.612, indicating that the model explains 61.2% of the variance in “SalePrice” on the training set.

48,It looks like the “income_categories” variable wasn’t retained in the split datasets. I’ll recreate it and then proceed with the regression analysis. The test R-squared value for the regression of “Limit” on “income_categories” is 0.418. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼
49,"It looks like there was an issue with accessing the “Age” variable in the encoded dataset. I’ll correct this and re-run the regression. It looks like the column names were incorrectly referenced after encoding. I’ll fix the column selection and rerun the regression.It appears that there was an issue with how the encoded variable names were accessed. I will carefully review the column names and rerun the regression correctly. The coefficient for “Age” in the regression of “Limit” on “income_categories” and “Age” is -2.210.
