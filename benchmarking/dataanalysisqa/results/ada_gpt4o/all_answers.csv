The problem may stem from an additional categorical feature that needs encoding. I will carefully inspect and ensure all necessary variables are properly encoded before proceeding. The issue arises from “LotShape,” which is categorical. I have already applied one-hot encoding, but I will ensure that the encoding was correctly applied and rerun the regression. ￼ It seems that “LotShape” is still not properly handled. To ensure everything is correctly processed, I will explicitly confirm the encoding and re-run the regression after verifying that no categorical variables remain unencoded.

I will inspect all columns in the dataset to identify any remaining categorical variables that need transformation.
