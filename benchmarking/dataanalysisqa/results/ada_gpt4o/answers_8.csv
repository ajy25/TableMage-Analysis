1,A total of 342 passengers survived. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼
2,There are 577 male passengers and 314 female passengers in the dataset. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼
3,"The mean age of passengers is 29.699 years, the median age is 28.0 years, and the standard deviation is 14.526 years. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"
4,There are 3 different values of “Pclass” in the dataset. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼
5,The average fare price is 32.204. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼
6,"The correlation between “Pclass” and “Fare” is -0.549, indicating a moderate negative relationship. This suggests that higher-class passengers (lower “Pclass” values) tended to pay higher fares. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"
7,"The t-test statistic is 6.839, and the p-value is 0.000. Since the p-value is below the significance level of 0.05, there is a statistically significant difference in fare price between those who survived and those who did not. Survivors tended to pay higher fares on average. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"
8,"The t-test statistic is -5.077, and the p-value is 0.000. Since the p-value is below the significance level of 0.05, there is a statistically significant difference in fare price between men and women. On average, women paid higher fares than men. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"
9,"The t-test statistic is -2.126, and the p-value is 0.036. Since the p-value is below the significance level of 0.05, there is a statistically significant difference in fare price between young and old passengers. On average, younger passengers paid higher fares than older passengers. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"

15,"The coefficient for “TotalSF” is 109.277, indicating that for each additional square foot, “SalePrice” increases by approximately 109.277. The coefficient is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. The intercept value is 15,955.121. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"
16,"It looks like “TotalSF” is missing in the train/test datasets. This likely happened because the transformation was applied to the full dataset but not the train/test split. I will now add “TotalSF” to both train and test datasets and rerun the regression. The train R-squared is 0.612, indicating that the model explains approximately 61.2% of the variance in “SalePrice” on the training set. The test RMSE is 49,768.440, which represents the average prediction error in dollars. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"

19,"The Shapiro-Wilk test statistic is 0.870, with a p-value of approximately 3.207e-33. Since the p-value is far below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the distribution of “SalePrice” is not normal. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"

24,"The mean malic acid content in the dataset is 2.336, with a standard deviation of 1.117. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"
25,"The skewness of the alcohol content is -0.051, indicating a nearly symmetric distribution. The kurtosis is -0.862, suggesting that the distribution is slightly platykurtic (flatter than a normal distribution). Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"
26,"The correlation between alcohol and malic acid is 0.094, indicating a very weak positive relationship. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"

	•	Class 0 vs Class 1: 1.000
	•	Class 0 vs Class 2: 1.000
	•	Class 1 vs Class 2: 0.991

These results indicate that the model performs exceptionally well in distinguishing between the wine classes. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"

29,The third largest value of “alcohol” in the dataset is 14.390. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼
30,"The dataset contains the following counts for each wine class:
	•	Class 1: 71 instances
	•	Class 0: 59 instances
	•	Class 2: 48 instances

Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"
31,It looks like the “meaningless” variable was created in the full dataset but hasn’t been retained in the split training and testing sets.

35,"The column “breast_cancer_yn” appears to be the indicator for the presence or absence of breast cancer. I will now perform a t-test to check if there is a statistically significant difference in “area error” between those with and without breast cancer. ￼ There is a statistically significant difference in area error between those with and without breast cancer (t = 12.156, p < 0.001). This suggests that area error differs significantly between the two groups. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"
36,"The coefficient for mean radius in the linear regression model predicting breast cancer presence is -2.006. This indicates that as the min-max scaled mean radius increases, the likelihood of having breast cancer decreases according to the model. Let me know if you need further insights. ￼"
37,"The coefficient for mean area in the linear regression model predicting breast cancer presence is -0.336. This suggests that as the standard-scaled mean area increases, the likelihood of having breast cancer slightly decreases according to the model. Let me know if you need further analysis. ￼"

48,It looks like the “income_categories” variable wasn’t carried over to the split datasets. I’ll correct that and rerun the regression. The test R-squared for the regression of “Limit” on “income_categories” is 0.418. Let me know if you need further analysis! ￼
49,"It looks like there’s an issue with accessing the “Age” column in the encoded dataset. I’ll correct it and rerun the regression. It looks like the one-hot encoding might have altered the feature names. I’ll inspect the actual column names and properly include “Age” in the regression. The coefficient for “Age” in the regression of “Limit” on “income_categories” and “Age” is -2.210. This indicates that, holding income category constant, each additional year of age is associated with a decrease of approximately 2.210 in the credit limit.
